A user-friendly, customizable chatbot powered by the OpenAI API to engage with your website visitors in real-time.

== Description ==

The **AI Chatbot Assistant** plugin allows you to easily add a smart, conversational chatbot to your WordPress website. Powered by OpenAI's powerful models (like GPT-3.5-Turbo), this chatbot can answer visitor questions, provide support, and enhance user engagement.
